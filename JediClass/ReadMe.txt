[h1]Jedi Class Mod[/h1]

[i]"For over a thousand generations, the Jedi were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic — before the dark times. Before the Empire."[/i]

Vanilla and Long War 2 compatible. 

[b]IMPORTANT Accidentally i chose the same mod id as the old jedi class mod by Marweezy. This means you can only run either this or the old mod not both at the same time.[/b]

For vanilla use my [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923981897]LW Promotion Screen For Vanilla[/url] to display all perk ranks and columns.

Jedi can't be trained in the Guerilla Training School and they are rare to get on rookie promotion.

[h1]Force Powers[/h1]

[i]"The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together." [/i]

A preview of the force powers can be seen here https://youtu.be/TXoFliFNDNM

Initiate: Force Jump, Lightsaber Slash, Leap Strike, Force Speed

[i]"Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force."[/i]

	[*]Force Fear (The wielder strikes directly at the deepest parts of the target's mind, causing an uncontrollable shaking fear that wreak havoc with the target's capabilities. This power is so subtle that its use does not break concealment. Can also target civilians and squad mates. This shifts your force alignment to the dark side.)

[h1]Force Alignment[/h1]

[i]"Strike me down with all your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete"[/i]

Following the path of the dark side will quickly make you stronger. If you are following your negative emotions and use dark force powers on civilian or squad mates you gain [b]Dark Side Points[/b].
Each Dark Side Points increases your hit chances with Dark Side Powers.
If you instead follow the path of the Light Side your are gaining [b]Light Side Points[/b]. This increases your hit chances with lightsaber related force powers and Jedi Mind Tricks but it will make it harder to use Dark Side Force Powers.
Healing squad mates with the force, finishing missions without killing anybody or carrying home wounded squad mates are consideres good deeds.
[i]
Luke: Vader... Is the dark side stronger?
Yoda: No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
